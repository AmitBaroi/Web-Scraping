	<h1>About me</h1>
	<p>
		<big>My name is</big> <i><b>Amit Robert Baroi,</b></i> <br>
		<br>
		All my life i wanted to be something extraordinary, somewhat of a super hero or a wizard! From my earliest childhood memories - I remember that I wanted to be a mad scientist, creating new strange devices and toys, discovering the hidden mechanisms of things, uncovering mysteries! Now it seems, that dream is within grasp.

		A few things propelled my towards where I am now,
		<ul>
			<li>Music</li>
			<li>Science</li>
			<li>Programming</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
		Music made me popular, opened my doors to so many more things <i>(too many!)</i> and so many possibilities.
		</p>
		<p>
		Science was my way into the real world! I had lost myself in a world diconnected from the one I should be living in! But through my pursuit of science I led me to greener pastures.
		</p>
		<p>
		Finally while frustrated about my life in NSU not having learnt much of any technical skill, I began to learn Java programming. I had learned Q-basic and C++ before, but this is the first time I really took the <ins>power of programming</ins> seriously! I made my first game in Java and that was one of the best experiences of my life!

		Looking forward to making true <i><big>magic!</big></i><br>
